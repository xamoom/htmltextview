</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">According to <span style="font-weight: bold;">local lore</span>, Maria Loretto chapel once housed a <span style="font-weight: bold;">splendid organ</span>, which was taken apart to send some of its pieces to Maria Saal. When the organ was taken away, the bell of the chapel was rung. The bell was so upset over the loss of the organ that it broke free from the bell rope and jumped in the lake, where it remains to this day, jammed between two mighty rocks at the dark lake bottom and guarded over by a huge crab. Divers once attempted to retrieve it, but were so scared by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">enormous size of the crab</span> that no other rescue attempt was ever made...&nbsp; </span></font><br></p>
